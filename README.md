TypeScript is a language that provides static type checking for JavaScript. It was developed by Microsoft, and it is an open-source project that is widely adopted by the development community. With TypeScript, you can catch errors before runtime, improve code readability and maintainability, and use advanced features such as classes, interfaces, and enums.
